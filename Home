<p>Welcome</p>
<p>This is a personal website about music, art, digital media and culture. I have created it as part of a project moduel to show off my very primiative hypertext skills.
  Nethertheless, what I have learnt had been interesting and I want to put it into something bigger and more grandiose. Betteryet, a website to showcase my music, art, and design work.</p>


  I am currently studying at the university of plymouth, based in the roland levinski building, this is what is looks like from the outside.<p>
